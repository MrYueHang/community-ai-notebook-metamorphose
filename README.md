# Gezypolis v2.0: The Omni-Layer OS

**Status:** Stable (React 18 Locked)
**Core:** Social Knowledge Operating System

Gezypolis v2.0 expands beyond a simple dashboard into a multi-dimensional "Citadel of Knowledge". It is designed to be intuitive ("Boomer-Friendly") while packing complex Project Management tools under the hood.

## 🚀 New Features (v2.0)

### 🧭 Omni-Deck Navigation
A large, centralized control deck at the bottom of the screen allows instant teleportation between system layers:
*   **Central Plaza:** The main hub for governance and economy.
*   **Education (Classroom):** For collaborative learning.
*   **Knowledge (Wiki):** Access the "2000-page PM Script" and community rules.
*   **Court:** Legal resolution and dispute management.
*   **Health:** Wellbeing tracking.
*   **Strategy (Chess):** Multidimensional planning room.

### 📋 Fullstack PM Taskbook
*   **Task Management:** Track Priority, Time Estimates, and Token Costs.
*   **Sticky Notes:** Add intuitive "Idea" notes to the board.
*   **Structure:** Based on professional Project Management milestones.

### 🧠 LettaAI Collaborator
A persistent sidekick that follows you between rooms. It maintains context of where you are (e.g., if you are in the "Court", it focuses on legal parameters).

## 🛠 Technical Fixes
*   **White Screen Resolved:** Downgraded `react` imports in `index.html` to v18.2.0 to ensure compatibility with the 3D engine (`react-three-fiber`).
